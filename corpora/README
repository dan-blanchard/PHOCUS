----- Brent and Cartwright (1996) version of BR corpus ----- 

The first corpus is a version of the Bernstein-Ratner corpus.  It was phonemicized by Brent and Cartwright (1996), and is available as the file br-old-gold.txt.  This corpus uses a single character for all diphthongs and vowel plus 'r' combinations.  It also uses different symbols for the 'r's in 'bird' and 'butter', which only differ on stress.  If you use this version of the corpus in a paper please cite the following:

----- Blanchard and Heinz (2008) version of BR corpus ----- 

The second corpus is another modified version of the Bernstein-Ratner corpus.  It takes the Brent and Cartwright version and splits the diphthongs and vowel+'r's into two symbols (with the exception of those whose first vowel does not occur in isolation in English).  It also collapses the stressed and unstressed syllabic 'r' sounds into one symbol.  This version of the corpus is available as br-gold.txt.

----- Johnson (2008) version of the Demuth Sesotho corpus ----- 

This only non-English corpus in this directory is in Sesotho (Bantu).  Johnson (2008) trimmed the Demuth (1992) corpus from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney & Snow, 1985) of speech between mother-child dyads to include only the child-directed speech. He did not convert the orthography to phonemes, because the writing system for Sesotho is nearly phonemic to begin with.  The final corpus contains 8,503 utterances consisting of 21,037 word tokens.  There is both a morpheme-segmented and word-segmented version of this corpus (sesotho-morph-gold.txt and sesotho-word-gold, respectively).
