Usage info for PHOCUS (segment.ml)
==================================
For help running PHOCUS, run ./segment.native -h after compiling.  It describes all of the default options.  
The default mode is PHOCUS-1.

Build Instructions for segment.ml
---------------------------------

Dependencies: caml-pcre, extlib

To build a particular program (e.g., segment.ml), just use ocamlbuild.  

Examples
--------
To get a native code version of the segmenter run:
	ocamlbuild segment.native

To get a byte code version run:
	ocamlbuild segment.byte

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you receive an error about some module not being a compiled interface, then that module must 
be recompiled with your current version of ocaml (or reinstalled if its an external library).


Usage info for Error Analyzer (errors.pl)
=========================================
The Error Analyzer script will give you a great deal of information about the errors a segmenter makes, 
including what percentage of true words and found words are over- and under-segmented, as well as word, 
boundary, and lexicon precision, recall, and F0 scores.  

Run ./errors.pl without arguments for help.
