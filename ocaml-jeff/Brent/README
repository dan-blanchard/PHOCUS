Requirements
************

There are two requirements:

1) A working installation of OCaML.  If you don't have this, you can get it
   from GODI at "http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/". You can find out more
   about OCaML (and also get it) from the OCaML homepage
   "http://caml.inria.fr/".

2) The tools library.  This package of modules is available where you got this-- at 
   "http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/grads/~jheinz/software/".  

************
Introduction
************

This package implements the Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Probabilistic
Utterance Segmentation as described by Brent 1999. The full citation is:

Brent, Michael. 1999. An Efficient, Probabilistically Sound Algorithm
for Segmentation and Word Discovery. Machine Learning 34, 71-105. 

There is an OCaML library 'brent' and a command line executable 'segment'.


*************************
Installation Instructions
*************************

1) Make sure that the Tools folder and the Brent folder are sister folders
   (i.e. in the same directory).

2) Make the current working directory /your/path/to/Brent.

3) At the command line enter the following.

       > make

   If the modules in Tools have not been made yet, this should do it (as well
   as the modules in Brent). 

4) To make command line executable run quickly on your machine, type:

       > make opt

   If `make opt' has not been run from the tools directory you will need to do
   switch to that directory, type `make opt' in that directory and then return
   to this directory and type `make opt'.

5) To produce the documentation, enter the following two commands. I recommend
   doing this to see how things work!

       > mkdir doc  

       > make doc

   There will be a number of warning errors that appear when you make the
   documentation. This is because I haven't figured out yet how to make it link
   to the documentation in the Tools directory.

6) That's it!


*******
Usage
*******

If you plan to use these program a lot, I recommend adding the following to your
.ocamlinit file, which should always be in your home directory.

   #directory "/your/path/to/Tools";;
   #directory "/your/path/to/Brent";;

   #load "tools.cma";;
   #load "brent.cma";;

The command line is run the way other OCaML executables are run. From the NaturalClass
directory, enter the following.

   > ./segment

If you plan to use the executable a lot, I recommend setting up an alias.  The
way you do this depends on what kind of shell you use. For the bash shell, you
can add the following to your .bashrc file (in your home directory).

alias fsa=/your/path/to/Brent/./segment

Then you can run it from anywhere.


*********
Examples
*********

There are some examples of usage of the OCaML modules in the directory called
"examples".  To see how the command line executable works, please consult the
documentation on the `segment' executable.
