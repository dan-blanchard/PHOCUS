Requirements
************

1) A working installation of OCaML.  If you don't have this, you can get it
   from GODI at "http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/". You can find out more
   about OCaML (and also get it) from the OCaML homepage "http://caml.inria.fr/".

Introduction
*************

TOOLS provides some more modules to be used in OCaML programming. These are:

File : functions for reading,writing, and manipulating files and directories.
Table : functions for manipulating tables  
Mstring : More functions for strings
Mlist : More functions for lists
Mset : More functions for sets
Mmap : More functions for maps
Mbool : More functions for booleans
Latex : some simple functions to assist automatic writing of LaTeX documents.
Delim : Some simple modules for implementing delimiters between the string
        representations of abstract types
X : An abstract type
Xset : Extended sets over abstract types
Xlist : Extended lists over abstract types
Xmap : Extended maps over abstract types


1) Make the current working directory /your/path/to/Tools

2) At the command line enter the following.

       > make


3) If you plan to use these modules in parts of other programs you will
   probably want to use the .cmx files which are native-code compiled for fast
   performance. So type the following:

       > make opt

4) To produce the documentation, enter the following two commands. I recommend
   doing this to see how things work!

       > mkdir doc  

       > make doc

These commands will make the tools.cma library and documentation.
Documentation can be found in the doc directory. Open doc/index.html to
begin learning about these modules.

******
Usage 
******

If you plan to use the modules in the Tools library a lot, I recommend adding
the following to your .ocamlinit file, which should always be in your home
directory.

   #directory "/your/path/to/Tools";;
   #load "tools.cma";;

For the most part, the modules are self-explanatory. The examples folder
illustrates how the X-family of modules can be used.
