PHOCUS is no longer under development
-------------------------------------

This is an archive of the work I was conducting while still pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.
The `code` directory has both the OCaml implementation of PHOCUS, which is described in the
publications listed [here](http://dan-blanchard.github.io/segmentation.html), and an unfinished
Python port.  The Python port was nearly complete, but I kept running into bugs in the NLTK 
`NgramModel` class (which has since been removed from NLTK).

The `corpora` directory has the infant-directed corpora that I used in my experiments. I provide
copies here to aid future researchers who might want to replicate my results.
