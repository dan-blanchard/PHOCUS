Build Instructions
------------------

Dependencies: caml-pcre, extlib

To build a particular program (e.g., segment.ml), just use ocamlbuild.  

Examples
------------------
To get a native code version of the segmenter run:
	ocamlbuild segment.native

To get a byte code version run:
	ocamlbuild segment.byte

Troubleshooting
------------------
If you receive an error about some module not being a compiled interface, then that module must 
be recompiled with your current version of ocaml (or reinstalled if its an external library).
